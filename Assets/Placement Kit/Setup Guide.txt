 What the Kit does:
 ------------------
 It checks for collision on the Terrain and with other objects (other buildings ect.),
 it also checks the height above the ground of the building.
 If a collision happens with other objects or the slope is to high the building is 
 RED highlighted and don't let you place the building.
 If it don't collide with other objects the building is
 GREEN highlighted and let you place the building.
 Every placed Building will be put in a public List with the
 Name of "buildings" which contains the GameObject and the Name
 as string without "(Clone)".
 
 You can configure in the Inspector the Max Slope Height,
 your array of different Objects / Buildings, the Selected Building Index,
 the Terrain Collision Tag.
 
 The Scripts are easily modified and they are self explanatory.


 Step 1:
 -------
 Create or Use a Existing Prefab of your Objects / Buildings.
 Use any Collider you like for your Objects / Buildings.
 And add a "Rigidbody" to them.
 In your Objects / Buildings "Ridgidbody" Freeze the "Rotation" and "Position"
 or your Objects / Buildings can bounce and move around.

 Step 2:
 -------
 Add a "Rigidbody" to your Terrain.
 In your Terrain "Ridgidbody" Freeze the "Rotation" and "Position"
 or your Terrain can bounce and move around.
 Set your Terrain Tag to (Your preferred Tag) example: "Floor".

 Step 3:
 -------
 Add the "BuildManager" Prefab to your Scene

 Step 4:
 -------
 In the "BuildManager" this are the settings:
 
 Selected Building: Is a Int which represents the Object / Building that's placed.
 Building -> Size: The total number of your different Objects / Buildings you want to use.
 Building -> Element: This is a GameObject Array in which you drag your Objects / Building
						Prefabs.
 Max Slope High: Here you can change the Max height difference between 
					  your Objects / Buildings and the ground.
 BuildingList: This variable don't show up in the Inspector but is a public variable
				 which contains a List with the placed Objects / Buildings Names + GameObjects.

 Set the "Terrain Collision Tag" to the Tag you given your Terrain.
 Drag your Object / Building Prefabs into the Element slots. The number behind the element
 represent the index in the Array and the "Selected Building" Index uses this index as well.

 Step 5:
 -------
 Enjoy, it is all SetUp and ready to use.

 NOTE:
 ------
 There is no buildin selected building switch script, you have to implement your own or take code from the Example Project GUIScript.
